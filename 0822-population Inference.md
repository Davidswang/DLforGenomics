### Introduction
Statistical inference for population genetics can be challenging, since determining the likelihood of complex population genetic models is often computationally intractable. 
#### Model Purpose

## Novelty
- **A KL divergence term is added in the cost function to ensure sparsity. This method is at least novel for me.** See page 19 of 28 in [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004845). 

- Fisrt employ deep learning in population genomics
- First jointly inferring demography and selection
  motivated by Drosophila genome
